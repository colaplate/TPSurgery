# TPSurgery
During surgery a lot of information is in need. Information needs to be displayed in a proper way. A tangible screen or button needs sterilization in the surgery room. Itâ€™s not possible for doctor to take off the glove for controlling. Thus we need gesture control for a more hygienic and convenient control. Also when the surgery light needs adjusting it's more convenient to control by gestures. By adding a tangible user interface in addition to graphical user interface, we developed a new method of providing feed forwards and feedbacks within the gesture control system.

TPSurgery is an interactive surgery assist system that helps showing information of patient and adjusting surgery light with non-touch control. With the system the surgeon can adjust surgery light in 3 dimensions as well as scanning through the patient's information with gestures with the indications of both graphical user interface and tangible user interface. We carefully designed and did user test on the interaction usability to make the system more accessible for the user.

TPSurgery has won the silver A Design Award in 2016, exhibited in Dubai Design Week and published on the HCI International 2017 as a poster.
